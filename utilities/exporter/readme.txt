This folder includes the Cinema4D plugin that exports a compatible scene into PBRT format. This exporter was originally included with the PBRTv3 distribution. We have made some modification to the exporter to allow ISET3d to easily parse the exported PBRT files.

To use this exporter, place the entire “PBRT Export” folder in the plugins folder of your Cinema4D installation. For example, on OSX, this might be “Applications⁩/MAXON⁩/⁨Cinema 4D R19 Student⁩/plugins.” 

After restarting C4D, you should see a "Export to PBRT..." option when clicking on the "Plugins" tab on the top of the window.
